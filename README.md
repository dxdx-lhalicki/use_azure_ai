# AI-Powered Document Processing Architecture on Azure with Terraform

## Overview

This repository contains a Terraform configuration to automate the deployment of an AI-driven document processing architecture on Microsoft Azure. The system leverages a variety of Azure services to handle document ingestion, processing, metadata storage, and indexing, providing a scalable and efficient solution for document management and analysis. This setup is ideal for use cases such as processing invoices, forms, or any unstructured document formats.

## Architecture Components

The key components of the architecture include:

- **Azure Web App**: Acts as the frontend for uploading documents to Azure Blob Storage.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores uploaded documents for processing.
- **Azure Queue Storage**: Triggers Azure Functions to process documents asynchronously.
- **Azure Functions**: Orchestrates document processing tasks:
  - **Analyze Activity**: Processes documents using Azure Cognitive Services.
  - **Metadata Store Activity**: Saves extracted metadata in Cosmos DB.
  - **Indexing Activity**: Sends processed documents to Azure Search for indexing.
- **Azure Cognitive Services (Form Recognizer)**: Extracts structured information from uploaded documents, such as text, tables, and key-value pairs.
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Stores metadata generated during document processing.
- **Azure Search Service**: Indexes documents for efficient searching and retrieval.

## Features

- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Uses Terraform to define and manage the cloud infrastructure in a repeatable and scalable way.
- **Serverless Processing**: Powered by Azure Functions, enabling efficient and cost-effective document processing that scales automatically.
- **AI-Driven Document Analysis**: Utilizes Azure Cognitive Services (Form Recognizer) to analyze documents and extract meaningful data.
- **Scalable Metadata Storage**: Uses Cosmos DB for fast, scalable, and structured storage of document metadata.
- **Searchable Document Indexing**: Integrated with Azure Search Service to provide fast document search and retrieval capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the infrastructure, ensure that you have the following:

- **Terraform**: Installed and configured. [Get Terraform here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
- **Azure Account**: An active Azure subscription.
- **Azure CLI**: For authentication (`az login`) or you can configure a Service Principal for non-interactive login.

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-document-processing-terraform.git
   cd ai-document-processing-terraform
   ```

2. Set up your Terraform environment:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Customize the variables in `variables.tf` to fit your Azure environment.

4. Preview the changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Once deployed, access the Azure Web App to begin uploading and processing documents.

### Customization

- **Service Tiers**: You can modify the service plan tiers, storage account types, and other resource settings by updating the respective Terraform configuration.
- **Functionality Extensions**: Add additional Azure Functions or modify the existing ones to handle different types of documents or data workflows.
- **Scaling**: Configure additional regions or enable autoscaling for services like Cosmos DB and Azure Functions for better performance in high-load environments.

## Use Cases

- **Invoice Processing**: Automate the extraction and processing of invoice data.
- **Form Digitization**: Convert scanned forms into structured digital data.
- **Document Search**: Store and index documents with metadata for fast retrieval and query via Azure Search.
